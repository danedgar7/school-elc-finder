# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
# School/ELC Finder Application

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the product requirements for a web application that enables parents to find the best School or Early Learning Center (ELC) for their children based on personalized criteria weightings. The application will allow for dynamic assessment, comparative analysis, and visual representation of schools/ELCs against user-defined priorities, making the decision-making process more objective and personalized.

## Problem Statement
Parents face significant challenges when selecting the right educational institution for their children due to:
- Overwhelming number of options
- Complex, multi-faceted decision criteria (Cost, Education, Staff, Facilities, Reputation, NQS)
- Difficulty in objectively comparing institutions
- Limited tools for personalized assessment based on individual family priorities
- Time-consuming research process

This application aims to transform this complex decision-making process into a data-driven, personalized experience that helps parents confidently identify the best fit for their child based on what matters most to them.

## User Personas

### Primary Persona: Decision-Making Parent
- **Demographics**: Parents/guardians of children aged 0-18 years
- **Goals**: Find the optimal educational environment for their child's needs
- **Pain Points**: Information overload, subjective recommendations, inability to compare options objectively
- **Needs**: Data-driven comparison tools, personalized analysis, clear visualizations

### Secondary Persona: Educational Advisor
- **Demographics**: School counselors, education consultants, relocation specialists
- **Goals**: Provide data-backed recommendations to families
- **Pain Points**: Lack of tools to objectively compare institutions based on client priorities
- **Needs**: Shareable analysis, detailed comparisons, evidence-based recommendations

## User Journeys

### Journey 1: Initial Assessment
1. User lands on the application homepage
2. User explores pre-loaded school/ELC options
3. User adjusts criteria sliders based on personal priorities

6. User saves or shares their personalized analysis

### Journey 2: Adding New School Options
1. User finds a school website not included in the database
2. User pastes the URL into the application
3. Application uses OpenAI API to analyze the new school
4. New school is added to the comparison
5. Analysis updates with the new option included
6. User adjusts criteria to see how the new school compares
