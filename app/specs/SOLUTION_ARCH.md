# School Scout - Solution Architecture

## 1. Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive solution architecture for the School Scout application, a tool designed to help parents compare and evaluate schools and early learning centers (ELCs) based on personalized criteria weightings. The solution architecture addresses both the current MVP implementation and the target state architecture to support future growth and feature expansion.

## 2. System Context

### 2.1 Business Context

School Scout aims to transform the complex decision-making process of selecting educational institutions into a data-driven, personalized experience. The application serves:

- **Primary Users**: Parents/guardians seeking educational institutions for their children
- **Secondary Users**: Educational advisors providing recommendations to families

## 3. Architecture Principles

### 3.1 Guiding Principles

1. **User-Centric Design**: Prioritize intuitive interfaces and meaningful interactions
2. **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Enable objective comparisons through quantifiable metrics
3. **Scalability**: Design for growth in user base and feature set
4. **Performance**: Ensure responsive UI and efficient calculations
5. **Maintainability**: Follow clean code practices and comprehensive documentation
6. **Security**: Protect user data and API integrations
7. **Accessibility**: Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### 3.2 Technical Principles

1. **Component-Based Architecture**: Use React components for modularity and reusability
2. **Static-First Approach**: Prioritize static generation where possible for performance
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript, enhanced with it
4. **API-First Design**: Well-defined interfaces between frontend and backend
5. **Responsive by Default**: Mobile-first design approach
6. **Test-Driven Development**: Comprehensive test coverage

- Static JSON data source
- Core comparison engine in JavaScript
- Basic visualization with charts and maps
- No user accounts or persistence

**Target State:**
- Full-stack application with API backend
- Database for school/ELC data and user preferences
- AI integration for school analysis
- Advanced visualizations and insights
- User accounts and preference saving
